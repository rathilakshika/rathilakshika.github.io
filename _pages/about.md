I am a Masters student in the Computer Sciences Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am currently a member of the [Quest Lab](https://quest-lab.cs.wisc.edu/), where I work under the guidance of [Prof. Swamit Tannu](https://swamittannu.com/). My primary research interests lie in Quantum Computing and Machine Learning, with a particular focus on Quantum Architecture and leveraging machine learning to address quantum problems.

I hold a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. During my undergrad, I focused on various aspects of Quantum Computing, gaining practical experience through internships in research labs and industry.
